# block_brute_force_ips
Blocks a list of known brute force hackers from a Linux server with iptables installed.

Used Python 3.5, but should work on Python 2.7. 

Note: This is a quick and dirty script made for a client with IP addresses in the /var/log/auth.log file that match known brute force attackers.
